## Projects

- **Train a Bitcoin trading agent with reinforcement learning:** because of the unbalanced scenario in Bitcoin market, we try to train an agent with reinforcement learning to Ô¨Ånd the arbitrage to make profit. The agent's performance could make positive revenue without considering the trancsation fees.
- **Tennis Result Prediction via Bayesian Models and Monte Carlo Methods:** by analyzing the historical data of the two players to get the distribution of the goal in each serve. By control, the variance of such a distribution, we can predict the result through the Markov Chain Monte Carlo.
- **Livestock Weight Prediction:** The Forecaster Livestock Team, financially supported by Agriwebb, will improve the prediction of livestock growth based on biophysical models and machine learning.
- **Foragecaster(demo):** is an innovative tool that integrates machine learning algorithms with biophysical models to accurately predict livestock weights. This approach enhances the precision of weight forecasts for better livestock management.
