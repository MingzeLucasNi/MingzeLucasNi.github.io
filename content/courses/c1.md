## Course Outline

This course covers the basic theory and applications of economic principles in energy. It discusses fundamental models used to describe the role of energy in the economy in micro and macro level. The course aim to give students understanding of the following: 

- The definition of energy economics which includes the basic definition of energy (classification, basic economic principle, scope of energy economics), characteristics of energy economics (scarcity, environment, imperfect market), and global energy issue (ownership rights of energy resources, energy price fluctuation, and renewable energy)
- The role of energy in microeconomic context covering basic theory of energy demand (theory, demand Function, demand elasticity), basic theory of energy supply (theory, supply function, supply elasticity) and energy market (market equilibrium, market disequilibrium, pareto optimality)
- The role of energy in macroeconomic context covering energy in GDP (simple circular flow, growth and economic equity, energy substitution with non-energy), energy in economic system (aggregate circular flow, fiscal sector, monetary sector), and the relation with macroeconomic indicators (effect of energy to inflation and foreign exchange rate, windfall profit and dutch disease)
- Production theory and cost of energy including energy production process (production input – output, production vs energy eeserves, elasticity vs intensity), cost of energy (marginal vs average cost, upstream vs downstream cost, production breakeven point), and energy depletion theory (renewable vs non-renewable energy, depletable, renewable)
- Energy investment evaluation including investment decision (net cash flow and net present value), economic criteria of producer vs government (depreciation, depletion, and amortization), risk and uncertainty (sensitivity analysis and probability), and
- Global energy and oil market including global energy mix market, market dynamic (future oil market, information system) and OPEC economic model (initial model, cartel model, hybrid model).
